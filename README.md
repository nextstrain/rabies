# Nextstrain repository for rabies virus
This repository contains two workflows for the analysis of rabies virus data:

- [`ingest/`](./ingest) - Download data from GenBank, clean and curate it and upload it to S3
- [`phylogenetic/`](./phylogenetic) - Filter sequences, align, construct phylogeny and export for visualization

Each folder contains a README.md with more information. The results of running both workflows are publicly visible at [nextstrain.org/rabies](https://nextstrain.org/rabies).

## Installation
